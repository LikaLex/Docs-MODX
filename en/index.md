### Extras

MODX Extras extend the core functionality of the MODX software. Other CMSs refer to them as "Plugins" or "Modules". Many of the Extras are developed by the MODX core team, while others are by third parties. Although by no means an exhaustive reference, the majority of the most popular Extras are documented here.

## What about MODX Evolution?

Evolution is MODX's classic codebase - the original version released in 2005. [As of April 2017](https://modx.com/blog/evolution-cms-has-a-new-home) Evolution is officially a separate project, no longer under the wings of MODX. That means Evolution has its own leadership, processes, and community.

All information about Evolution, including documentation and extras, can be found at [evo.im](https://evo.im/).
